<p>
I am keen on supervising prospective PhD students who are interested in doing research on the following thematic subjects (with specialist focus on East and Southeast Asia):

 * Ethnoreliogious Otherings, Violent Conflicts, and Affective Peacebuilding
 * The Security Politics and Political Economy of International Trade
 * Emotions, Populism, and Foreign Policy
 * Religion and Nationalism
