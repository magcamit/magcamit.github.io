title: "A Costly Affirmation: Exploring Malaysia's One-Sided Domestic Security Dilemma"
subtitle: ''
summary: "The Barisan Nasional's construction and implementation of ideational and\
\  material security apparatuses has created a one-sided internal security dilemma\
\  in Malaysia. This paper argues that the noble objective of promoting Malay interests\
\  has been transformed to the venal objective of securing Barisan's political perpetuity\
\  that is being pursued under the pretext of achieving inter-ethnic parity within\
\  a pluralistic Malaysia. The government's quest for a bumiputra-imagined nation gave\
\  birth to affirmative action policies that have often worked at the expense of all\
\  other Malaysian ethnic groups, particularly the Chinese and Indian-Malaysians. For\
\  better or worse, Malaysia's national security is conceived and developed on the\
\  basis of bumiputra ethnicity. In other words, Malaysia's national security is designed\
\  to counter mainly the insecurities confronting the Malays, thereby generating a
\  one-sided internal security dilemma."

abstract: The Barisan Nasional's construction and implementation of ideational and

  in Malaysia. This paper argues that the noble objective of promoting Malay interests
  has been transformed to the venal objective of securing Barisan's political perpetuity
  that is being pursued under the pretext of achieving inter-ethnic parity within
  a pluralistic Malaysia. The government's quest for a bumiputra-imagined nation gave
  birth to affirmative action policies that have often worked at the expense of all
