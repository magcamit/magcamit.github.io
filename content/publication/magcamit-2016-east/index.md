title: 'East and South China Seas Maritime Dispute Resolution and Escalation: Two
  Sides of the Same Coin?'
subtitle: ''
summary: "Our assumptions about the nature and conduct of contemporary international\
\  politics deeply impact how we view maritime disputes plaguing the East and South\
\  China Seas. In this article, our analysis of the push and pull factors that influence\
\  the extent and possible resolution of maritime disputes in East Asia reveals that\
\  war is neither opposed in principle nor completely forbidden as an alternative.\
\  Amid heightening maritime tensions in the region, we argue that the underlying forces\
\  sustaining complex interdependence are what prevent rival states from engaging into\
\  a realist-inspired, zero-sum warfare. However, this is not to suggest that economic\
\  interdependence creates an absolute power that completely eradicates these flashpoints,\
\  and neither do we imply that it faithfully reflects East Asia’s maritime political\
\  reality. Although East Asian countries (particularly the more powerful ones) may\
\  think that open war can be justified, as a matter of practical utility, avoiding\
\  it is likely to be more effective in achieving the goals of a given conflict."

abstract: Our assumptions about the nature and conduct of contemporary international
  politics deeply impact how we view maritime disputes plaguing the East and South
  China Seas. In this article, our analysis of the push and pull factors that influence
  the extent and possible resolution of maritime disputes in East Asia reveals that
  war is neither opposed in principle nor completely forbidden as an alternative.
  Amid heightening maritime tensions in the region, we argue that the underlying forces
  sustaining complex interdependence are what prevent rival states from engaging into
  a realist-inspired, zero-sum warfare. However, this is not to suggest that economic
  interdependence creates an absolute power that completely eradicates these flashpoints,
  and neither do we imply that it faithfully reflects East Asia’s maritime political
  reality. Although East Asian countries (particularly the more powerful ones) may
  think that open war can be justified, as a matter of practical utility, avoiding
  it is likely to be more effective in achieving the goals of a given conflict.
