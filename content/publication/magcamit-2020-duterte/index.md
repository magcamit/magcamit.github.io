title: 'The Duterte method: A neoclassical realist guide to understanding a small
  power’s foreign policy and strategic behaviour in the Asia-Pacific'
subtitle: ''
summary: "In the contemporary Asia-Pacific context, the fault lines leading to the\
  \ Thucydides trap can be attributed to the continuing strategic competition between\
  \ a seemingly declining United States and a rising China. Failure to circumvent\
  \ this trap can ultimately result in a war of all against all. Against this backdrop,\
  \ this article investigates how a small power re-evaluates its foreign policy and\
  \ strategic behaviour using neoclassical realism theory. In particular, I examine\
  \ President Rodrigo Duterte's method which is characterized by four key elements:\
  \ cultivating a more favourable image for China; moderating the country’s American-influenced\
  \ strategic culture; mobilizing state-society relations supportive of `Sinicization';\
  \ and reorienting the country's Western-based institutions to better accommodate\
  \ Chinese pressures and incentives. Does a China-centric approach give a small power\
  \ an indispensable strategic capital to successfully navigate and exploit both the\
  \ challenges and opportunities of the impending new order? Do the Philippines' shifting\
  \ rules of engagement under the Duterte administration represent a forward-thinking\
  \ strategic outlook rather than a defeatist and naïve stance? The article answers\
  \ these questions by examining the factors and dynamics underpinning the conception\
  \ and construction of the Duterte method, as well as its implications vis-a-vis\
  \ a small power’s foreign policy and strategic behaviour."
