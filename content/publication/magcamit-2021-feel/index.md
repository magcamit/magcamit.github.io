title: "To feel is to believe: China, United States, and the emotional beliefs of\
  \ Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte"
subtitle: ''
summary: "The ongoing shifts in the global distribution of material and normative\
\  powers, particularly between the United States and China, have significant repercussions\
\  on the foreign policy strategies of smaller, weaker actors in the international\
\  system. Due to their limited capacity for dictating international politics in ways\
\  that could guarantee their survival, many in IR have argued that they usually prefer\
\  to operate within the prevailing status quo rather than attempting to revise it.\
\  Nevertheless, the Philippines, under the leadership of President Rodrigo Duterte,\
\  seems to disprove this observation by dramatically pivoting towards Beijing and\
\  away from Washington, at least rhetorically. This paper moves beyond the commonly\
\  cited systemic factors and domestic intervening variables affecting the states'\
\  foreign policies by examining the neglected emotions and emotional beliefs that\
\  help shape these instruments. My investigation of these unseen, albeit existing\
\  mechanisms, reveals the centrality of Duterte’s emotionally constituted and strengthened\
\  beliefs in providing a more complete and realistic explanation to his China-centric\
\  (as opposed to US-centric) foreign policy stance. As I argue and demonstrate throughout\
\  the paper, because emotions and emotional beliefs are powerful engines of human\
\  behaviour, they exert enormous influence on any state leader’s foreign policy motivations,\
\  decisions, and actions."

abstract: The ongoing shifts in the global distribution of material and normative
  powers, particularly between the United States and China, have significant repercussions
  on the foreign policy strategies of smaller, weaker actors in the international
  system. Due to their limited capacity for dictating international politics in ways
  that could guarantee their survival, many in IR have argued that they usually prefer
  to operate within the prevailing status quo rather than attempting to revise it.
  Nevertheless, the Philippines, under the leadership of President Rodrigo Duterte,
  seems to disprove this observation by dramatically pivoting towards Beijing and
  away from Washington, at least rhetorically. This paper moves beyond the commonly
  cited systemic factors and domestic intervening variables affecting the states'
  foreign policies by examining the neglected emotions and emotional beliefs that
  help shape these instruments. My investigation of these unseen, albeit existing
  mechanisms, reveals the centrality of Duterte’s emotionally constituted and strengthened
  beliefs in providing a more complete and realistic explanation to his China-centric
  (as opposed to US-centric) foreign policy stance. As I argue and demonstrate throughout
  the paper, because emotions and emotional beliefs are powerful engines of human
  behaviour, they exert enormous influence on any state leader’s foreign policy motivations,
  decisions, and actions.
