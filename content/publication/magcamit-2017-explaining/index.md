title: "Explaining the three-way linkage between populism, securitization, and realist\
  \ foreign policies: President Donald Trump and the pursuit of ``America first''\
  \ doctrine"
subtitle: ''
summary: "In the age of growing global populism, the continued popularity and relevance\
\  of a populist government is anchored on the ability of its populist leader to convince\
\  the voters that the primary objective of his foreign policies is to secure the interests\
\  of the state and its citizens. However, without an adequate level of state power,\
\  pursuing realist foreign policies to improve the state’s relative gains and position\
\  in the international system can pose significant risks even for the most influential\
\  populist leader. Hence, the question is, how do populist leaders acquire an adequate\
\  level of state power to implement realist foreign policies, without ultimately losing\
\  their political capital and institutional legitimacy in the process? To answer this\
\  question, I develop a model that illustrates the three-way linkage between populism,\
\  securitization, and realism. I use this model to explain the rationale behind President\
\  Donald Trump's `America First' doctrine, as well as its implications for U.S. foreign\
\  policy making. I argue that ``populist securitization'' is a conduit through which\
\  populist leaders formulate, execute, and justify their realist foreign policies.\
\  Using Trump's securitization of the U.S. economy as a case study, I reveal how a\
\  populist securitization act can trigger the illiberal tendencies and nativist sentiments\
\  of the nationalistic voters, which, in turn, allow populist leaders to maintain\
\  their popularity and legitimacy among these voters while they experiment with realist\
\  foreign policies."

abstract: In the age of growing global populism, the continued popularity and relevance
  of a populist government is anchored on the ability of its populist leader to convince
  the voters that the primary objective of his foreign policies is to secure the interests
  of the state and its citizens. However, without an adequate level of state power,
  pursuing realist foreign policies to improve the state’s relative gains and position
  in the international system can pose significant risks even for the most influential
  populist leader. Hence, the question is, how do populist leaders acquire an adequate
  level of state power to implement realist foreign policies, without ultimately losing
  their political capital and institutional legitimacy in the process? To answer this
  question, I develop a model that illustrates the three-way linkage between populism,
  securitization, and realism. I use this model to explain the rationale behind President
  Donald Trump's `America First' doctrine, as well as its implications for U.S. foreign
  policy making. I argue that ``populist securitization'' is a conduit through which
  populist leaders formulate, execute, and justify their realist foreign policies.
  Using Trump's securitization of the U.S. economy as a case study, I reveal how a
  populist securitization act can trigger the illiberal tendencies and nativist sentiments
  of the nationalistic voters, which, in turn, allow populist leaders to maintain
  their popularity and legitimacy among these voters while they experiment with realist
  foreign policies.
