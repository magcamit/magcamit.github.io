title: Trading in Vain? Investigating the Philippines' Development-oriented National
  Security and Free Trade Linkages
subtitle: ''
summary: "This paper examines the manner through which the Philippine government has\
\  utilized free trade in pursuing its development-oriented national security policies\
\  and strategies in the twenty-first century. It argues that against the backdrop\
\  of uneven economic development being perpetuated by a deeply entrenched oligarchic\
\  system and patronage culture, the primary referent of Philippine national security\
\  is its diminishing development space. Despite the government rhetoric with regard\
\  to the role of inclusive development in enhancing national security, the Philippine\
\  political economy remains highly oligarchic and patrimonial. Such a condition has\
\  resulted in institutionalized inequality and structural poverty that undermine the\
\  country's supposedly development-based security model. The ability of the very few\
\  yet very powerful Filipino elites to transform the country into an oligarchipelago\
\  underscores the inefficiencies emanating from this type of politico-economic arrangement.\
\  In light of this, the paper evaluates the impacts of the Philippines' free trade\
\  activities on its overall level of development space by focusing on several crucial\
\  aspects of free trade that the government has failed to properly consider. Moreover,\
\  it scrutinizes the key factors that affect the utility of free trade for securing\
\  and enhancing the Philippines' development space. The paper concludes by arguing\
\  that the Philippine government's attempts at linking its development-centric security\
\  interests and free trade objectives have resulted not only in the preservation of\
\  uneven economic development and but also the further reinforcement of the existing\
\  oligarchic system and patronage culture in the country."

abstract: This paper examines the manner through which the Philippine government has
  utilized free trade in pursuing its development-oriented national security policies

  political economy remains highly oligarchic and patrimonial. Such a condition has
