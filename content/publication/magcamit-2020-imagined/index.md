title: 'Imagined Insecurities in Imagined Communities: Manufacturing the Ethnoreligious
  Others as Security Threats'
subtitle: ''
summary: "How does a once familiar and benign ethnoreligious community become a stranger\
\  and a threat? This article examines the underlying causal mechanisms driving rival\
\  ethnoreligious factions within pluralistic polities to frame each other as threats\
\  to their relative security, power, and status. Drawing on complementary theories\
\  from critical security, religious, and nationalism studies, I develop a framework\
\  that captures and explains the processes and dynamics through which threatening\
\  conceptions and narratives about the ethnoreligious others are constructed, socialized,\
\  and legitimized over time. To theoretically probe and empirically demonstrate the\
\  utility of this framework, I examine how the collective imagined insecurities among\
\  Muslim and Christian communities in Indonesia have crystallized into tangible security\
\  threats using the interpretive process tracing method. Evidences produced from my\
\  theoretical and empirical analyses using the novel qualitative data I gathered from\
\  my field research reveal that this chauvinistic, zero-sum phenomenon proceeds via\
\  a three-phase othering causal mechanism comprised of cultivation of hostile emotive\
\  effects of ethnoreligious nationalism, securitization of othered ethnoreligious\
\  groups using hostile symbolic predispositions, and sacralization of hostile perceptions\
\  of indivisible ethnoreligious identities and homelands."
