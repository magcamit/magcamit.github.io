title: 'A case for cohabitative security: The Philippine and Malaysian experience'
subtitle: ''
summary: "This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting\
\  the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries.\
\  Using the Philippines and Malaysia as case studies, the article determines the extent\
\  to which public officials and policymakers have redefined and reenvisioned national\
\  security by incorporating non-traditional, people-centered elements of human security.\
\  The word `cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist\
\  and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national\
\  security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements\
\  state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist\
\  in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In\
\  other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both\
\  cases underscore a two-pronged assumption. First, the meaning and provision of national\
\  security can neither be eloquently articulated nor completely substantiated without\
\  considerations for 'below the state' actors and issues. And second, the eminent\
\  status vis-à-vis power of the state in providing national security can neither be\
\  trivialized nor undermined."

abstract: This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting
  the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries.
  Using the Philippines and Malaysia as case studies, the article determines the extent
  to which public officials and policymakers have redefined and reenvisioned national
  security by incorporating non-traditional, people-centered elements of human security.
  The word `cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist
  and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national
  security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements
  state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist
  in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In
  other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both
  cases underscore a two-pronged assumption. First, the meaning and provision of national
  security can neither be eloquently articulated nor completely substantiated without
  considerations for 'below the state' actors and issues. And second, the eminent
  status vis-à-vis power of the state in providing national security can neither be
  trivialized nor undermined.
