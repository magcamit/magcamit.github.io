title: "The fault in Japan's stars: Shinzo Abe, North Korea, and the quest for a new\
  \ Japanese constitution"
subtitle: ''
summary: "In the wake of North Korea’s progressive missile testing that set even the\
\  usually stoic Japanese people into a panic mode, Japan has found itself at the mercy\
\  of its former enemies. In an ironic twist of fate, Tokyo’s security outlooks seem\
\  to have become hostage to the strategic calculations of its fiercest nemesis in\
\  the past. This paper asks whether Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s desire for constitutional\
\  change is precipitated mainly by the resurgence of Japanese nationalist sentiments\
\  as what many of his critics claim, or if there are genuinely rational justifications\
\  for revising the country’s 72-year old Constitution. And if so, why has it been\
\  so elusive for many Japanese leaders? Using neoclassical realism theory, I analyze\
\  the structural contexts and domestic intervening variables that simultaneously drive\
\  and prevent the realization of constitutional change in Japan. I argue that state\
\  leaders like Abe and those who have come before him have always been prone to acquiring\
\  flawed and inaccurate perceptions of the systemic stimuli; susceptible to making\
\  irrational and unsound decisions; and ineffective at mobilizing the national resources\
\  demanded by their preferred policies and strategies. Thus, despite having rational\
\  justifications, the quest for constitutional change has remained elusive for many\
\  Japanese leaders. Success will require Abe to carefully harmonize domestic and international\
\  expectations; prudently balance Japan’s benign security intentions and hawkish military\
\  strategies; and shift away from his pragmatic–ambivalent style of domestic politics."
