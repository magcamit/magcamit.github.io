<p>
Hello! I’m Michael Magcamit, Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Global Politics at The University of Manchester in the UK. Before joining Manchester, I was a Lecturer in Security Studies at the University of Leicester and a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the Queen Mary University of London. Prior to moving to the UK, I was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Musashi University in Tokyo, Japan, where I convened International Relations modules on a joint program between the University of London (LSE) and Musashi. 
</p>
<p>
My research and teaching interests sit at the intersection of Critical International Security, Conflict, Development, and Foreign Policy Studies with a specialist focus on the Asia-Pacific. 
</p>
<p>
I am the author of, among others, <i>Ethnoreligious Otherings and Passionate Conflicts</i> (OUP 2022) and <i>Small Powers and Trading Security</i> (Palgrave/Springer 2016).
