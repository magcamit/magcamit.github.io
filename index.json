This research investigates the three-way linkages between security, religion, and nationalism, exploring how relations between dominant and minority religions influence the formation of national security policies in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, Islamic Indonesia, and Buddhist Myanmar. My current work is an extension and expansion of my overarching goal to provide a better and more nuanced understanding of (in)security, both from the perspectives and experiences of states and human societies across the world. In my earlier projects, I examined the contexts, motives, and outcomes that were driving the small powers in Southeast and East Asia to link their security interests and free trade policies, including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines (see my publications).

In doing so, it analyses the increasingly complex connections between trade and security, demonstrating how these linkages affect the overall security of four small but important states in East Asia. Focusing on the role of high levels of internal and external insecurities, marginal geo-economic size and peripheral geopolitical position, and multidimensional and multidirectional security contexts and threats, the author concludes that for every security enhancement that a linkage creates a consequent security risk is generated. In other words, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines are effectively trading their security. This innovative book will appeal to political scientists, economists, and security and trade experts.  Reviews \u0026ldquo;A comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the complex ways that small countries integrate their trade policies with other domestic and international policy objectives. This book offers important insights into the political economy of Asia, as well as to the importance of trade policy linkages.\u0026rdquo; (David Vogel, University of California, USA)\n\u0026ldquo;Are Asia\u0026rsquo;s free trade agreements merely \u0026lsquo;much ado about nothing\u0026rsquo;? No, says this important and original book: for small states, they can be matters of life and death. Potently challenging both realism and liberalism, Small Powers shows how weak states create trade linkages to gain both state and human security – but also how this can create new forms of insecurity. This is a significant contribution to the literature on security studies, international political economy, Asian regionalism, and small states’ foreign policies.\u0026rdquo; (Lee Jones, Queen Mary University of London, UK)\n","date":1480530600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480530600,"objectID":"8453efd75b1f8e18dfca2214d2688348","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/project/sectralink-ea/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/sectralink-ea/","section":"project","summary":"Trading Security: Understanding East Asian Security-Trade Linkages in the Twenty-first Century","tags":["Politics","Security","Trading"],"title":"SecTraLink-EA","type":"project"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441045800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441045800,"objectID":"d77fa4a74076ffcd7ca6c21cfc27a4b2","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/person-re-id/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/person-re-id/","section":"publication","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372617000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372617000,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database.
