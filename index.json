This article examines the underlying causal mechanisms driving rival ethnoreligious factions within pluralistic polities to frame each other as threats to their relative security, power, and status. Drawing on complementary theories from critical security, religious, and nationalism studies, I develop a framework that captures and explains the processes and dynamics through which threatening conceptions and narratives about the ethnoreligious others are constructed, socialized, and legitimized over time. To theoretically probe and empirically demonstrate the utility of this framework, I examine how the collective imagined insecurities among Muslim and Christian communities in Indonesia have crystallized into tangible security threats using the interpretive process tracing method. Evidences produced from my theoretical and empirical analyses using the novel qualitative data I gathered from my field research reveal that this chauvinistic, zero-sum phenomenon proceeds via a three-phase othering causal mechanism comprised of cultivation of hostile emotive effects of ethnoreligious nationalism, securitization of othered ethnoreligious groups using hostile symbolic predispositions, and sacralization of hostile perceptions of indivisible ethnoreligious identities and homelands.","tags":null,"title":"Imagined Insecurities in Imagined Communities: Manufacturing the Ethnoreligious Others as Security Threats","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Divine Tragedy of Securing the Sacred: Security, Religion, and Nationalism in Southeast Asia\nA EU Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Project: 1 Mar 2019 \u0026ndash; 28 Feb 2021.

Failure to circumvent this trap can ultimately result in a war of all against all. Against this backdrop, this article investigates how a small power re-evaluates its foreign policy and strategic behaviour using neoclassical realism theory. In particular, I examine President Rodrigo Duterte's method which is characterized by four key elements: cultivating a more favourable image for China; moderating the country's American-influenced strategic culture; mobilizing state-society relations supportive of 'Sinicization'; and reorienting the country's Western-based institutions to better accommodate Chinese pressures and incentives. Does a China-centric approach give a small power an indispensable strategic capital to successfully navigate and exploit both the challenges and opportunities of the impending new order? Do the Philippines' shifting rules of engagement under the Duterte administration represent a forward-thinking strategic outlook rather than a defeatist and na\"{i}ve stance? The article answers these questions by examining the factors and dynamics underpinning the conception and construction of the Duterte method, as well as its implications a vis-a-vis a small power's foreign policy and strategic behaviour.","tags":null,"title":"The Duterte method: A neoclassical realist guide to understanding a small power’s foreign policy and strategic behaviour in the Asia-Pacific","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546268400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576461403,"objectID":"77fb154f80cc39d6d28641e1d6c9cda2","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit2019fault/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit2019fault/","section":"publication","summary":"In the wake of North Korea's progressive missile testing that set even the usually stoic Japanese people into a panic mode, Japan has found itself at the mercy of its former enemies. In an ironic twist of fate, Tokyo's security outlooks seem to have become hostage to the strategic calculations of its fiercest nemesis in the past. This paper asks whether Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's desire for constitutional change is precipitated mainly by the resurgence of Japanese nationalist sentiments as what many of his critics claim, or if there are genuinely rational justifications for revising the country's 72-year old Constitution. And if so, why has it been so elusive for many Japanese leaders? Using neoclassical realism theory, I analyze the structural contexts and domestic intervening variables that simultaneously drive and prevent the realization of constitutional change in Japan. I argue that state leaders like Abe and those who have come before him have always been prone to acquiring flawed and inaccurate perceptions of the systemic stimuli; susceptible to making irrational and unsound decisions; and ineffective at mobilizing the national resources demanded by their preferred policies and strategies. Thus, despite having rational justifications, the quest for constitutional change has remained elusive for many Japanese leaders. Success will require Abe to carefully harmonize domestic and international expectations; prudently balance Japan's benign security intentions and hawkish military strategies; and shift away from his pragmatic–ambivalent style of domestic politics.","tags":null,"title":"The fault in Japan's stars: Shinzo Abe, North Korea, and the quest for a new Japanese constitution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483196400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"5f0fe7e8563fe5fd926746ef3612ec71","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2017-explaining/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2017-explaining/","section":"publication","summary":"In the age of growing global populism, the continued popularity and relevance of a populist government is anchored on the ability of its populist leader to convince the voters that the primary objective of his foreign policies is to secure the interests of the state and its citizens. However, without an adequate level of state power, pursuing realist foreign policies to improve the state's relative gains and position in the international system can pose significant risks even for the most influential populist leader. Hence, the question is, how do populist leaders acquire an adequate level of state power to implement realist foreign policies, without ultimately losing their political capital and institutional legitimacy in the process? To answer this question, I develop a model that illustrates the three-way linkage between populism, securitization, and realism. I use this model to explain the rationale behind President Donald Trump's 'America First' doctrine, as well as its implications for U.S. foreign policy making. I argue that ''populist securitization'' is a conduit through which populist leaders formulate, execute, and justify their realist foreign policies. Using Trump's securitization of the U.S. economy as a case study, I reveal how a populist securitization act can trigger the illiberal tendencies and nativist sentiments of the nationalistic voters, which, in turn, allow populist leaders to maintain their popularity and legitimacy among these voters while they experiment with realist foreign policies.","tags":null,"title":"Explaining the three-way linkage between populism, securitization, and realist foreign policies: President Donald Trump and the Pursuit of ''America First'' Doctrine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Small Powers and Trading Security: Contexts, Motives, and Outcomes is available for purchase on the following websites.\n https://bit.ly/2HGnOq9 https://bit.ly/2JryDyM https://bit.ly/2JDZdFh https://bit.ly/2YbbRie https://amzn.to/2CtnAiV https://bit.ly/2Wb3gtM https://bit.ly/2CsXJr3  About the book This book examines why and how small powers link their security interests and trade agendas, and how security threats influence the facilitation and outcome of their trade activities.

Amid heightening maritime tensions in the region, we argue that the underlying forces sustaining complex interdependence are what prevent rival states from engaging into a realist-inspired, zero-sum warfare. However, this is not to suggest that economic interdependence creates an absolute power that completely eradicates these flashpoints, and neither do we imply that it faithfully reflects East Asia’s maritime political reality. Although East Asian countries (particularly the more powerful ones) may think that open war can be justified, as a matter of practical utility, avoiding it is likely to be more effective in achieving the goals of a given conflict.","tags":null,"title":"East and South China Seas Maritime Dispute Resolution and Escalation: Two Sides of the Same Coin?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451574000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"d05ed9c0c570260182c25880a741e8da","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","section":"publication","summary":"This book examines why and how small powers link their security interests and trade agendas, and how security threats influence the facilitation and outcome of their trade activities.

It argues that against the backdrop of uneven economic development being perpetuated by a deeply entrenched oligarchic system and patronage culture, the primary referent of Philippine national security is its diminishing development space. Despite the government rhetoric with regard to the role of inclusive development in enhancing national security, the Philippine political economy remains highly oligarchic and patrimonial. Such a condition has resulted in institutionalized inequality and structural poverty that undermine the country's supposedly development-based security model. The ability of the very few yet very powerful Filipino elites to transform the country into an oligarchipelago underscores the inefficiencies emanating from this type of politico-economic arrangement. In light of this, the paper evaluates the impacts of the Philippines' free trade activities on its overall level of development space by focusing on several crucial aspects of free trade that the government has failed to properly consider. Moreover, it scrutinizes the key factors that affect the utility of free trade for securing and enhancing the Philippines' development space. The paper concludes by arguing that the Philippine government's attempts at linking its development-centric security interests and free trade objectives have resulted not only in the preservation of uneven economic development and but also the further reinforcement of the existing oligarchic system and patronage culture in the country.","tags":null,"title":"Trading in Vain?

This paper examines how Singapore has embedded itself at the centre of regional and global trade systems by exploiting various forms of free trade activities including multilateral, regional and bilateral FTAs that underpin its security and survival. It argues that in order to maintain the city-state's geo-economic and geo-political viability, the Singaporean government has progressively linked its security interests with its multilevel free trade activities. Given the ‘vulnerability fetish’ and siege mentality that confront Singaporean leaders and policymakers, the pursuit of economic development via free trade has become the heart of its national security policy and strategy. The paper concludes by arguing that the enhancement and preservation of Singapore's survival as a sovereign nation-state demands a strategic utilization of FTAs with different trade partners, especially with regional and trans-regional powers such as the United States and China.","tags":null,"title":"Trading in Paranoia: Exploring Singapore's Security-Trade Linkages in the Twenty-first Century","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388502000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"9bd32ee5046345304ed7c4c557893ece","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2014-case/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2014-case/","section":"publication","summary":"This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries.

The word 'cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both cases underscore a two-pronged assumption.

Due to this existing cross-strait security dilemma, Taiwanese leaders are being forced to preserve the island's quasi-independent statehood due to fears of losing its remaining de facto autonomy over domestic and foreign affairs.
