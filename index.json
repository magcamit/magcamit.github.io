[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"This website is a work-in-progress!\nHello! I am Michael Magcamit, currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in the School of Politics and International Relations at Queen Mary University of London. I am working on a project entitled, The Divine Tragedy of Securing the Sacred: Security, Religion and Nationalism in Southeast Asia. This research investigates the three-way linkages between security, religion, and nationalism, exploring how relations between dominant and minority religions influence the formation of national security policies in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, Islamic Indonesia, and Buddhist Myanmar. My current work is an extension and expansion of my overarching goal to provide a better and more nuanced understanding of (in)security, both from the perspectives and experiences of states and human societies across the world. In my earlier projects, I examined the contexts, motives, and outcomes that were driving the small powers in Southeast and East Asia to link their security interests and free trade policies, including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines (link to publications). Prior to joining QMUL, I was an assistant professor at Musashi University in Tokyo, Japan where I taught International Relations and East Asian Studies courses on a joint program between the London School of Economics and Musashi University (link to teachings). Having previously lived and worked in the Philippines, New Zealand, Japan, and now, United Kingdom, I refer to myself as \u0026lsquo;the wandering sensei\u0026rsquo; (link to The Wandering Sensei).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"This website is a work-in-progress!\nHello!

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372617000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372617000,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database.
