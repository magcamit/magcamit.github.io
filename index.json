During my travel, I met several interesting people from Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines (including a former member of an extremist Islamist rebel group called Jemaah Islamiyah) who shared their insights regarding the dynamics in the relationships between the members of the predominant and minority religious groups in their respective states. Beginning on September 1, 2019, I will be returning to these countries to conduct a three-month fieldwork in the following key areas: Manila and Zamboanga (alt. Marawi) in the Philippines, Jakarta and West Papua (alt. Yogyakarta) in Indonesia, and Yangon and Mandalay (alt. Rakhine) in Myanmar. I will spend 30 days in each country to gather data from my elite and non-elite participants by conducting interviews and doing semi-ethnographic observations. In the meantime, I am writing my first journal manuscript for this project entitled, Why Nation-States Persist, which I will be presenting at the 77th Annual Midwest Political Science Association Conference in Chicago, Illinois in the April of 2019.

However, without an adequate level of state power, pursuing realist foreign policies to improve the state's relative gains and position in the international system can pose significant risks even for the most influential populist leader. Hence, the question is, how do populist leaders acquire an adequate level of state power to implement realist foreign policies, without ultimately losing their political capital and institutional legitimacy in the process? To answer this question, I develop a model that illustrates the three-way linkage between populism, securitization, and realism. I use this model to explain the rationale behind President Donald Trump's 'America First' doctrine, as well as its implications for U.S. foreign policy making. I argue that ''populist securitization'' is a conduit through which populist leaders formulate, execute, and justify their realist foreign policies. Using Trump's securitization of the U.S. economy as a case study, I reveal how a populist securitization act can trigger the illiberal tendencies and nativist sentiments of the nationalistic voters, which, in turn, allow populist leaders to maintain their popularity and legitimacy among these voters while they experiment with realist foreign policies.","tags":null,"title":"Explaining the three-way linkage between populism, securitization, and realist foreign policies: President Donald Trump and the Pursuit of ''America First'' Doctrine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Small Powers and Trading Security: Contexts, Motives, and Outcomes is available for purchase on the following websites.\n https://bit.ly/2HGnOq9 https://bit.ly/2JryDyM https://bit.ly/2JDZdFh https://bit.ly/2YbbRie https://amzn.to/2CtnAiV https://bit.ly/2Wb3gtM https://bit.ly/2CsXJr3  About the book This book examines why and how small powers link their security interests and trade agendas, and how security threats influence the facilitation and outcome of their trade activities.

In this article, our analysis of the push and pull factors that influence the extent and possible resolution of maritime disputes in East Asia reveals that war is neither opposed in principle nor completely forbidden as an alternative. Amid heightening maritime tensions in the region, we argue that the underlying forces sustaining complex interdependence are what prevent rival states from engaging into a realist-inspired, zero-sum warfare. However, this is not to suggest that economic interdependence creates an absolute power that completely eradicates these flashpoints, and neither do we imply that it faithfully reflects East Asia’s maritime political reality. Although East Asian countries (particularly the more powerful ones) may think that open war can be justified, as a matter of practical utility, avoiding it is likely to be more effective in achieving the goals of a given conflict.","tags":null,"title":"East and South China Seas Maritime Dispute Resolution and Escalation: Two Sides of the Same Coin?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451574000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"d05ed9c0c570260182c25880a741e8da","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","section":"publication","summary":"This book examines why and how small powers link their security interests and trade agendas, and how security threats influence the facilitation and outcome of their trade activities.

It argues that against the backdrop of uneven economic development being perpetuated by a deeply entrenched oligarchic system and patronage culture, the primary referent of Philippine national security is its diminishing development space. Despite the government rhetoric with regard to the role of inclusive development in enhancing national security, the Philippine political economy remains highly oligarchic and patrimonial. Such a condition has resulted in institutionalized inequality and structural poverty that undermine the country's supposedly development-based security model. The ability of the very few yet very powerful Filipino elites to transform the country into an oligarchipelago underscores the inefficiencies emanating from this type of politico-economic arrangement. In light of this, the paper evaluates the impacts of the Philippines' free trade activities on its overall level of development space by focusing on several crucial aspects of free trade that the government has failed to properly consider. Moreover, it scrutinizes the key factors that affect the utility of free trade for securing and enhancing the Philippines' development space. The paper concludes by arguing that the Philippine government's attempts at linking its development-centric security interests and free trade objectives have resulted not only in the preservation of uneven economic development and but also the further reinforcement of the existing oligarchic system and patronage culture in the country.","tags":null,"title":"Trading in Vain?

This paper argues that the noble objective of promoting Malay interests has been transformed to the venal objective of securing Barisan's political perpetuity that is being pursued under the pretext of achieving inter-ethnic parity within a pluralistic Malaysia. The government's quest for a bumiputra-imagined nation gave birth to affirmative action policies that have often worked at the expense of all other Malaysian ethnic groups, particularly the Chinese and Indian-Malaysians. For better or worse, Malaysia's national security is conceived and developed on the basis of bumiputra ethnicity. In other words, Malaysia's national security is designed to counter mainly the insecurities confronting the Malays, thereby generating a one-sided internal security dilemma.","tags":null,"title":"A Costly Affirmation: Exploring Malaysia's One-Sided Domestic Security Dilemma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420038000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"78c50a361a37b937c1e43959fda98eaf","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2015-games/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2015-games/","section":"publication","summary":"This article examines Taiwan's cross-strait relations with China by analyzing the linkages between their respective security interests and free trade objectives in the twenty-first century. It argues that these entanglements induce a scenario akin to the prisoner's dilemma that compels Taiwanese leaders and policymakers to preserve the Chinese-dominated cross-strait status quo. To enhance their political appeals during general elections, the major political parties in Taiwan are being forced to cooperate with each other, albeit artificially. By adopting a parallel, watered-down approach to sensitive political issues, particularly with respect to Taiwan's sovereignty status, the omnipresent China factor is being legitimized further. Such an approach homogenizes the parties' political agendas with respect to Taiwanese autonomy which leads to the island's perpetual entrapment within the One-China trajectory. Using original and secondary sources in the empirical analysis of the security–trade nexus mainly from the Taiwanese perspective, the article highlights the slow yet steady co-optation of Taiwan's sovereign interests within China's sinicization project.","tags":null,"title":"Games, Changes and Fears: Exploring Taiwan's Cross-Strait Dilemma in the Twenty-first Century","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420038000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"a7f3abd17a6ab51eba40fe9ebd196c7c","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2015-trading/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2015-trading/","section":"publication","summary":"Singapore's rude awakening to independence has led to the creation of one of the most important and strategic entrepôts in the Asia-Pacific. The country's limited territorial lands and natural resources, combined with huge per capita income, high population density and sensitive racial mix, make Singapore the quintessential pragmatic trading state of the twenty-first century. This paper examines how Singapore has embedded itself at the centre of regional and global trade systems by exploiting various forms of free trade activities including multilateral, regional and bilateral FTAs that underpin its security and survival. It argues that in order to maintain the city-state's geo-economic and geo-political viability, the Singaporean government has progressively linked its security interests with its multilevel free trade activities. Given the ‘vulnerability fetish’ and siege mentality that confront Singaporean leaders and policymakers, the pursuit of economic development via free trade has become the heart of its national security policy and strategy. The paper concludes by arguing that the enhancement and preservation of Singapore's survival as a sovereign nation-state demands a strategic utilization of FTAs with different trade partners, especially with regional and trans-regional powers such as the United States and China.","tags":null,"title":"Trading in Paranoia: Exploring Singapore's Security-Trade Linkages in the Twenty-first Century","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388502000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"9bd32ee5046345304ed7c4c557893ece","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2014-case/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2014-case/","section":"publication","summary":"This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries. Using the Philippines and Malaysia as case studies, the article determines the extent to which public officials and policymakers have redefined and reenvisioned national security by incorporating non-traditional, people-centered elements of human security. The word 'cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both cases underscore a two-pronged assumption. First, the meaning and provision of national security can neither be eloquently articulated nor completely substantiated without considerations for 'below the state' actors and issues. And second, the eminent status vis-à-vis power of the state in providing national security can neither be trivialized nor undermined.","tags":null,"title":"A case for cohabitative security: The Philippine and Malaysian experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit","Alexander C Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388502000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553736127,"objectID":"54f846de88c1f31760d88e40ee949764","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2014-crouching/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2014-crouching/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper seeks to explore and explain the process through which Taiwan utilizes free trade – both at multilateral and bilateral levels – in enhancing its shrinking de facto sovereignty against the backdrop of ubiquitous 'China factor' in the twenty-first century. It argues that China's sinicization project creates a scenario wherein increasing cross-strait stability ironically leads to decreasing de facto sovereignty for Taiwan. Due to this existing cross-strait security dilemma, Taiwanese leaders are being forced to preserve the island's quasi-independent statehood due to fears of losing its remaining de facto autonomy over domestic and foreign affairs. In essence, Taiwan chooses to be de facto free by remaining de jure unfree. Taiwan's sovereign space, therefore, becomes a pivotal referent object of its national security policy and strategy. Balancing between the two paradoxical interests of enhancing sovereignty while maintaining the Chinese-dominated cross-strait status-quo underlines the relentless games, changes, and fears that Taiwan confronts today.","tags":null,"title":"Crouching tiger, lurking dragon: understanding Taiwan's sovereignty and trade linkages in the twenty-first century","type":"publication"}]
