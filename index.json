In doing so, it analyses the increasingly complex connections between trade and security, demonstrating how these linkages affect the overall security of four small but important states in East Asia. Focusing on the role of high levels of internal and external insecurities, marginal geo-economic size and peripheral geopolitical position, and multidimensional and multidirectional security contexts and threats, the author concludes that for every security enhancement that a linkage creates a consequent security risk is generated. In other words, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines are effectively trading their security. This innovative book will appeal to political scientists, economists, and security and trade experts.  Reviews \u0026ldquo;A comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the complex ways that small countries integrate their trade policies with other domestic and international policy objectives. This book offers important insights into the political economy of Asia, as well as to the importance of trade policy linkages.\u0026rdquo; (David Vogel, University of California, USA)\n\u0026ldquo;Are Asia\u0026rsquo;s free trade agreements merely \u0026lsquo;much ado about nothing\u0026rsquo;? No, says this important and original book: for small states, they can be matters of life and death. Potently challenging both realism and liberalism, Small Powers shows how weak states create trade linkages to gain both state and human security – but also how this can create new forms of insecurity. This is a significant contribution to the literature on security studies, international political economy, Asian regionalism, and small states’ foreign policies.\u0026rdquo; (Lee Jones, Queen Mary University of London, UK)\n","date":1480518000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480518000,"objectID":"8453efd75b1f8e18dfca2214d2688348","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/project/sectralink-ea/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/sectralink-ea/","section":"project","summary":"Trading Security: Understanding East Asian Security-Trade Linkages in the Twenty-first Century","tags":["Politics","Security","Trading"],"title":"SecTraLink-EA","type":"project"},{"authors":["Michael I Magcamit","Alexander C Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451574000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451574000,"objectID":"f7abd82c07a6b3e4a6fc43d55f077eed","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2016-east/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2016-east/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"East and South China Seas Maritime Dispute Resolution and Escalation: Two Sides of the Same Coin?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Intal Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451574000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451574000,"objectID":"d05ed9c0c570260182c25880a741e8da","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2016-small/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Small powers and trading security: Contexts, motives and outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael I Magcamit"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451574000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451574000,"objectID":"951284e876f672973acfcba422a254fc","permalink":"https://www.magcamit.com/publication/magcamit-2016-trading/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magcamit-2016-trading/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Trading in Vain?
